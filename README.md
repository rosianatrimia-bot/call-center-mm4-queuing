# M/M/4 Call Center Queueing Model

This repository contains data, code, and results used to model a call center
as an M/M/4 queueing system using real operational data.
The project reproduces all tables and figures reported in the paper.

## Dataset

The dataset is obtained from Kaggle (Call Center Dataset).
Only calls from January 1 and January 4, 2021 are used.

Main variables:
- call_started
- call_answered
- call_ended
- wait_length (seconds)
- service_length (seconds)
- meets_standard (boolean)

The dataset used in this repository is a cleaned version of the original Kaggle dataset,
and the preprocessing steps are described in the paper.


## Reproducibility

To reproduce the main results:

1. Place the cleaned dataset in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the provided Jupyter/Colab notebook (`antrian_model.ipynb`) in the `src/` folder.
3. The script computes:
   - Arrival rate (λ)
   - Service rate (μ)
   - Queueing performance metrics (Wq, W, P(wait))
4. Output tables are saved in the `results/` folder.
5. Figures are generated and saved in the `figures/` folder.

All reported numerical values in the paper are generated from this dataset.

The tables stored in the `results/` folder correspond to the tables reported
in the paper. In some cases, a single output table generated by the code is
split into multiple tables in the LaTeX manuscript for clarity and presentation
purposes. All numerical values remain identical to the original program output.

## Units and Parameters

All time-related variables are expressed in seconds.

Parameters:
- λ : arrival rate (calls per second)
- μ : service rate (calls per second)
- c : number of servers (c = 4)

All computations use consistent time units.
